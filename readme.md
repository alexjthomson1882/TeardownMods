# TEARDOWN MODS
These are a collection of mods for a game called [Teardown](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1167630/Teardown/).

### INSTALLATION
My mods can be found on the steam workshop [here](https://steamcommunity.com/id/quacky_boi/myworkshopfiles/) and can be directly installed from there.
To manually install these mods, clone the repo and move any directories in the root project directory to `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Teardown\mods`. You can then enable the mods through the mods section on Teardown.
